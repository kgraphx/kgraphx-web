Targeted   at   sentiment   analysis   of   short   text comparing with long text, the word-based segmentation faces the other problem that there are the more ambiguous or unregistered words in context of short text. The feature extraction done by the different   Chinese   Word   Segmentation   impact   the   statistic distribution  of  features,  and  further the  accuracy  of  sentiment analysis. This paper evaluates five Chinese segmentation strategy effect on Sentiment Analysis of Short Text.  We chose two word-based Chinese Word Segmentation (CWS), and three char-based n-gram and made usage of Zipf’s law to quantify and present the result of word segmentation.</p>]]></content>
